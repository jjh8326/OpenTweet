//NOTE: Normally I do not commit this but I wanted to give you a little insight into how my brain works when coding. Often when I code I make notes on how I would solve a problem, below are my (cleaned up) notes on how I would load a tweet's replies

//TODO: Algorithm to optimally sort and store tweet replies, the VC will pass on the root tweet, we just need to get the replies

//To accomplish this:
//Create a dictionary - [ ROOT ID: [REPLIES] ]
//Sort the replies

//Steps
//1. Loop through the timeline and add all root tweets IDs as a key to a dictionary and create the above data structure
//2. Loop through the timeline again and this time add all non root nodes (nodes with the "inReplyTo" field) to the value of the dictionary which is a array of tweets
//NOTE: It would be nice to not have to loop through the timeline twice but we have to because a root node is not guaranteed to be before a reply node
//3. Sort the reply array in each dictionary (created in step 1), sort the tweets by the time interval between the root and reply
//5. You now have a sorted tweet reply structure :D
